With <a href="http://amazon.co.uk">Amazon UK</a> shipping Kindle to India, I am tempted to buy it. With my growing collection of books, I am running out of space on my bookshelf. Also I feel very sad when the old books turn pale, the paper crumbles and the book starts to smell. A kindle to me seems to be a very good alternative for books in the future. I have used the kindle app on my phone and I have nothing against reading books on devices. But I wanted to do a bit of my own analysis, on how cost effective it is to buy books on the Kindle. Using some Python and web scraping (<a href="https://github.com/sheki/sheki/blob/master/kindleVFlipkart/kindlePrice.py">script link</a>) I calculated the price of books on my Wishlist on Flipkart (<a href="http://www.flipkart.com/wishlist/kona">link</a>) and on Kindle. 10 of the books are cheaper on Kindle, 8 of them are cheaper on Flipkart,17 books do not have a kindle edition.
