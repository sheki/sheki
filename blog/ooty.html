The nature and hills are better appreciated when you are slowly cycling away on the slopes.
You see the tress shedding the old brown leaves from winter, the sunlight seeping throught the foilage, the large Eucalyptus tress, the asbestos roofed houses, the Toda people cleaning working on the tea estates. 
Ooty has the glimpses of Ruskin Bond's Dehra, the lone long market street, the choclate shops, the hangover of the British era visible in the mentions of boarding schools, rechristened stores (Mohan), the abundant churches, missionaries, YWCA and more. 
How I would love to stay longer, how I would love to spend a summer, walking up the slopes, taking short cuts through the tea gardens, shopping in Mohan's, talking to the odd sboarding school student and living a life in a hill station - living in Ooty.
