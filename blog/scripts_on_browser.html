<p>I am not a big fan of Javascript. But I do feel the need of writing scripts or customizations on top of the websites I commonly visit (usually of the comparison sort, not aimed at the UI).  I achieve these customizations by writing Greasemonkey scripts.</p>
<p>But I am not comfortable in writing apps and scripts in a language chosen by someone else i.e. the browser developers. (Must confess I am java script handicapped). So I was wondering if there was a project or an attempt to create a virtual layer which could translate Pythonic or Rubyish code on the browser to the underlying Javascript (native) calls.</p>
<p>Google does the same thing on the Android. The project is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">SL4A</a>(Scripting Layer for Android). The interpreter layer converts the higher language functions to Java RPC (native Android functions).</p>
<p>Scripting might not be the best way to build apps but it definitely is much easy to prototype and play around in Python than in Javascript. Also comin to think when most of the web apps are accessed through a browser, the browser is turning into the OS required (Google ChromeOS Project, I know).</p>
<p> So does anyone know of any such project ,which allows multiple languages on top of a browser. I have tried the basic google but of no use. Let me know if any of you find anything.</p>
